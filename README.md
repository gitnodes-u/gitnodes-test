# gitnodes-test

The gitnodes-test repository is a public, open-source example of a GitNodes node, designed to showcase the capabilities and structure of a GitNodes repository. It serves as a reference point for users and developers who want to create their own GitNodes repositories or understand the underlying principles and mechanics of the GitNodes ecosystem.

The gitnodes-test repository contains a few key components:

1. gitnodes.json: A JSON file containing the core data of the GitNodes node, such as the node's ID, name, type, picture URL, and description. This file is the central point of information for the node and can be updated and modified through the GitNodes API.

2. GitHub Pages: A simple, static website hosted using GitHub Pages that provides a user-friendly interface for viewing and editing the information contained in the gitnodes.json file. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and interacts with the GitNodes API to fetch and update the node data.

3. Founding Document: A file, similar to a LICENSE file, containing the foundational rules, decision-making processes, and other important information about the organization or individual represented by the GitNodes node. This document serves as a guide for understanding the governance and structure of the node.

4. README.md: A Markdown file that provides an overview of the gitnodes-test repository, explaining its purpose, contents, and how to use it as a reference for creating new GitNodes nodes.

5. The gitnodes-test repository aims to be a comprehensive example of a GitNodes node, offering guidance and best practices for users looking to create their own nodes. It demonstrates the use of the GitNodes Agent GitHub App and the GitNodes API to securely and efficiently manage and update the node data, while maintaining the decentralized nature of the GitNodes ecosystem.
